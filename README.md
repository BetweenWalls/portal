### [Download](https://github.com/BetweenWalls/planner/archive/master.zip)

### Features:

* synergy calculation for all skills
* display section for active skill(s)
* character stats
* mercenary selection
* equipment selection & modification (corrupting, socketing, upgrading)
* charm inventory
* snapshotting

### Future Goals:
* mercenary stats
* total calculated damage for minions
* IAS breakpoint info (frames per attack) for skills which don't use normal breakpoints
* breakdown of attack damage by type
* skill effectiveness (dps, area affected, movement capability)
* full GUI inventory/stash
* custom item creation & affix editing
* custom item-pool saving
* options for individual quests
* option for strict character validation (prevent invalid character states instead of just making text red)
* character importing/sharing
* monster stat calculations
* debuff tracking
* party tracking (i.e. buffs from party members)
* pvp info
* comparison to original D2 skills/stats
* dynamic item/skill recommendations

### Known Issues:
* Charms can't be moved into a new space below the original space if they overlap eachother
* Shift + Right Click in Firefox doesn't work (and still opens the default menu)
* Socketed gems/runes/jewels sometimes aren't aligned like they should be
* DoT (Damage over Time) stats are added without considering their time component

### Controls:
* Click on the character's level or class to change them
* Use right click to remove points or items
* Shift and ctrl modify the amount added or removed (also works on items in the charm inventory)
* Corruptions may be selected via the narrow dropdowns to the left of each item dropdown
* Upgrading can be done by ctrl-clicking the equipped item (ctrl + right-click to downgrade)
* Snapshot effects by ctrl-clicking the effect's icon

This project will likely be made open-source at some point, but if you want to contribute directly before that point, any improvements would be welcome.
